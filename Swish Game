To solve the problem, we need to determine the number of rings, 
𝑁
N, that could be involved in a game based on the sequence of moves Toofan made. Each test case provides:

𝑀
M: The number of moves made by Toofan.
𝐾
K: The number of swishes needed to win the game.
A string 
𝑆
S of length 
𝑀
M representing the sequence of moves.
The game ends when either:

Toofan has achieved 
𝐾
K swishes.
It becomes impossible to achieve 
𝐾
K swishes with the remaining moves.

#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int t;
    cin >> t;
    while (t--) {
        int mov, k;
        cin >> mov >> k;
        string s;
        cin >> s;
        
        int cnt = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++) {
            if (s[i] == 'S') {
                cnt++;
            }
        }

        if (cnt >= k) {
            cout << mov << endl;
        } else {
            int diff = k - cnt;
            cout << mov + diff-1 << endl;
        }
    }

    return 0;
}
