To solve the problem where Toofan wants to convert the string S to the target string "ADVITIYA", we need to calculate the minimum steps required to transform each character of 
S to the corresponding character in "ADVITIYA". The transformation involves cycling through the alphabet, and in each step, you can move a character to the next one in the cyclic alphabet.



#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int main() {
	int t;
	cin>>t;
	while(t--){
	    string s;
	    cin>>s;
	    string target="ADVITIYA";
	    int steps=0;
	        for(int i=0;i<8;i++){
	            int diff = (target[i] - s[i] + 26 ) %26;
                steps += diff;
	        }
	        cout<<steps<<endl;
	    }
	
	return 0;
};
